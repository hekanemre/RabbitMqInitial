Welcome!
This project is an entry-level message broker application built using RabbitMQ.
The main goal is to understand the basic messaging concepts — sending and receiving messages — before moving toward more advanced RabbitMQ features.

Overview
Publisher: Sends messages to a specified queue.

Subscriber: Listens to the queue and consumes incoming messages.

RabbitMQ Instance: Hosted on CloudAMQP for simplicity and accessibility.

Currently, this project uses a direct queue connection. In the future, we plan to explore exchanges and different routing patterns.
